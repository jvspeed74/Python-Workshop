# RNA to Protein Translator

This Python script translates RNA sequences into protein sequences using a codon table. It also provides options to
print the length of the encoded protein and the most commonly occurring codon.

## Purpose

The purpose of this program is to facilitate the translation of RNA sequences into their corresponding protein
sequences. It can be useful in various biological and computational biology applications where RNA-to-protein
translation is necessary.

## Input

The program takes RNA sequences as input. These sequences should be provided as strings.

## Expected Output

The program outputs the protein sequence corresponding to the input RNA sequence. Additionally, it can optionally print
the length of the encoded protein and the most commonly occurring codon.

## Execution

The program can be executed by running the `main()` function. It includes predefined test cases, but users can modify or
add their own test cases as needed.

## Improvement Suggestions

- Performance Optimization: Optimize the translation process for better performance, especially for large RNA sequences.
- Expand Codon Table: Consider expanding the codon table to include rare codons or support different organisms.
- User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for easier interaction with the program.
