# Deck of Playing Cards

## Purpose

The purpose of this program is to define dictionaries representing a standard deck of 52 playing cards using two
different schemas. These schemas organize the cards based on either the suit first or the card value first.

## Input

This program does not take any input. It only defines two dictionaries (`suit_value_dict` and `value_suit_dict`)
representing the deck of cards.

## Output

This script can be used to create representations of a standard deck of playing cards in Python. You can utilize these
dictionaries to perform various card-related operations or incorporate them into larger card game projects.

## Execution

The program includes declarative execution, where dictionaries are defined to represent the deck of cards. There's no
procedural execution included in this program as it doesn't perform any runtime actions.

## Improvement Suggestions

- Add functionalities to manipulate the deck of cards, such as shuffling, dealing, or checking for specific cards.
